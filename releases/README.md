# Releases

### Version Number Scheme
Release version notation is made of three integers `x`, `y` and `z` delimited by `.` (i.e. `x.y.z`). Incrementation of version numbers follows the following rules:
- `z` - incremented on **minor** updates such as bug-fixes, optimizations, refactor, ect.
- `y` - incremented on **major** updates such as feature additions.
- `x` - incremented on **breaking** updates such that at least some feature is not fully backwards compatible.
